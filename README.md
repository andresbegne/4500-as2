## Usage
This project provides implementations for various polynomial interpolation methods. Refer to the individual question files in src/main for details on each method.
By running the main script 'src/main/assignment_2', results for all five questions will be produced. 

##Running the Program

To run the main script, use the following command: src/main/assignment_2.py
